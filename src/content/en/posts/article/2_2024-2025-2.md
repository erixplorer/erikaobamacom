In the [last article](/posts/1_2024-2025), I explained why I renewed this website. In this article, I'm going to talk about the technical side of the renewal.

## 1. Deciding a website objective and choosing development tools

First, I set an objective for the new website to not blur the future direction. I also thought about the criteria for choosing the right tools.

- Website objective: To show my skills and thoughts
	- It functions as a magazine, an inspiration source, and a CV
- Tool criteria
	- Tools that let me practice using the modern webdev workflow to improve my skills and save production time.
	- It must generate a static website. This way, I don't have to worry about the security vulnerability of dynamic website platforms like WordPress.

Then, I chose the following tools to create a new website: 

1. Preparation tools
	- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)
		- An open-source whiteboard tool. It feels like pen and paper = less friction. 
		- This time, I used its Obsidian plugin to streamline my production flow.
	- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
		- A wireframing tool that I use regularly at work.
2. Development tools
	- Website generator: [Astro](https://astro.build/)
		- A static website generator that is common nowadays, and many people say it makes personal website development easy.
		- It has integrations with Git, GitHub, Netlify, Cloudflare, React, Tailwind CSS, and many more platforms and frameworks.
		- I can utilize my knowledge of Hugo and Vue.JS, too.
		- Astro allows HTML tags inside a .md file (which Hugo doesn't).
	- CSS framework: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
		- At work, I was surprised how it supports rapid CSS coding.
		- It can make my website low-maintenance since it follows the technology advancements, and updates frequently. 
	- Code editor: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
		- With these extensions: WSL, Astro, Git Graph, and JavaScript Debugger Companion Extension
3. Image creation tools
	- [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)
		- Is my to-go image editor.
	- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
		- For 3D work, this is my favorite all-in-one tool.

## 2. Preparation

### Getting inspired and informed

Since improving my web design/development knowledge and skills was one of my objectives, I started the production by gathering screenshots of multiple websites for inspiration and analysis.

I took notes on:
- structures 
- visual approach to make their personal/professional brands
of good design websites to find out what kind of design I want my website to have.

Also, I checked some YouTube videos for a better understanding of good web design.
- https://www.youtube.com/@AnthonySistilli/
	(Roasting your portfolios series)
- https://www.youtube.com/@MalewiczHype
	(his design tutorials have good logical explanations)

### Learning Astro with a step-by-step tutorial

Although I'm used to using [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) (a static website generator) and [Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org/), Astro was still a new website generator that I had to learn from the basics. To get the maximum effect from learning, for me, following [a step-by-step tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/) was very helpful. (Bonus: I could use this sample website as a reusable template.)

## 3. Designing

### 1. Concept

I wanted to make the new website
- A place where viewers feel friendliness and a relaxing atmosphere, and my personality
- Updates frequently (no perfection)
	- It can be an excuse, but I dropped the idea of building a perfect website from the beginning to overcome my inertia.

### 2. Rough sketching

The design process always starts with rough sketching. I used Excalidraw (and pen and paper) for this, and sketched structures of these pages: 

- Index: summary of the website
- Articles: my thoughts, thinking style, and visual skills
- About: who I am, skills, and job history (CV)

<a href="/src/images/article/2_2024-2025-2/2_2024-2025-2_excalidraw.webp"><img src="/src/images/article/2_2024-2025-2/2_2024-2025-2_excalidraw_thumb.webp"></a>


And, considered color schemes and font combinations, too. 
- https://colormagic.app/ was very useful for testing different color combination patterns.
- For fonts, I considered using web fonts at first but found out that it takes too much resources just to load with Japanese web fonts. So, I ended up using the web-safe fonts below. 

``` css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'heading';
  src: local("Futura"), local("Trebuchet MS"), local("ヒラギノ角ゴ ProN"), local("Hiragino Kaku Gothic ProN"), local("游ゴシック"), local("YuGothic"), local("Yu Gothic"), local("メイリオ"), local("Meiryo"), local("ＭＳ ゴシック"), local("MS Gothic"), local("HiraKakuProN-W3");
  font-weight: normal;
  font-style: normal;
  font-display: swap;
}
@font-face {
  font-family: 'reading';
  src: local("Andale Mono"), local("Consolas"), local("ヒラギノ角ゴ ProN"), local("Hiragino Kaku Gothic ProN"), local("游ゴシック"), local("YuGothic"), local("Yu Gothic"), local("メイリオ"), local("Meiryo"), local("ＭＳ ゴシック"), local("MS Gothic"), local("HiraKakuProN-W3");
  font-weight: normal;
  font-style: normal;
  font-display: swap;
}
```


### 3. Figma (to test the actual look)

To test if the sketched design and color scheme actually work, and to finalize them, I made PC/mobile views for each page on Figma. 

<a href="/src/images/article/2_2024-2025-2/2_2024-2025-2_figma_lt.webp"><img src="/src/images/article/2_2024-2025-2/2_2024-2025-2_figma_lt_thumb.webp"></a>
<a href="/src/images/article/2_2024-2025-2/2_2024-2025-2_figma_dk.webp"><img src="/src/images/article/2_2024-2025-2/2_2024-2025-2_figma_dk_thumb.webp"></a>


### 4. Code (Astro)

After deciding on the final look, I modified the sample website that I made by following a tutorial. 

First, I added additional integrations: 
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** for easy, rapid development.
- **[Tailwind CSS Animated](https://www.tailwindcss-animated.com/)** to add an analog and personal feel to the website.
- **[i18n support](https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/i18n/)** to make it bilingual (English/Japanese).

Then, started by: 
1. Adding CSS variables (font family, colors, etc.) to global.css.
2. Creating Astro components like header.astro, navigation.astro, and footer.astro for reusability.

Since I believe in reusable assets for effortless project production and less hassle website management, making the code reusable as much as possible was crucial. So, in this phase, I tried anticipating variables and components I would need as much as possible.

### 5. Deploy (GitHub → Cloudflare Pages)

After finishing coding, I deployed my website to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

But, why Cloudflare Pages over [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) which is recommended in the step-by-step tutorial? The reason is simple. Because (as of Feb 2025,) Cloudflare has much more data centers in Asia including Japan, while Netlify has a few. Speedy connection from anywhere is very important, especially when the website is image-heavy, and offers multiple languages from different parts of the world. 

I took these steps to publish the website: 
1. Create a new GitHub repo.
2. Sign-up to Cloudflare.
3. Create a Cloudflare Pages project integrated with the GitHub repo, to automatically deploy the source code.
4. Added a custom domain (erikaobama.com).


That's it!
