For a long time, this website was <a href="https://v2024.erikaobama.com/" target="_blank">a showcase of my digital art</a>. But now, I decided to do a renovation to make it something different.

The reason? Let me explain a little.

## 1. Professional focus: now it's design, not art

> The idea had been added as a "to-do" in my brain three decades before, then had slipped beneath my consciousness. Evidently, it had been in my head all this time, taking up mental space.<br/>
> — Greg Mckeown (Effortless)

When I was young, I dreamed about becoming an illustrator who makees fantasy, anime-style aesthetics. By being raised in a country full of anime, I adopted this visual style naturally. I even thought *THIS was the way*. 

Then, as I got older and experienced life challenges, I became more interested in sharing life tips to help uplift people's lives.

A similar thing happened to my visual style. I understood that the aesthetic anime style no longer aligned with my needs. But, because of the old belief, I couldn't give a try on the new direction.

Though, I made a switch from 2D to 3D art. 
I tried to mix motion graphics with anime art to explain my thoughts on daily topics.

None of these *modicications* solved my issues. I couldn't get many social media followers, but I lost lots of them instead. I became much more insecure than before. I needed a radical solution.

I asked myself: 
*Honestly, do I want to continue sharing my artistic vision? Wasn't I obsessed with the expression style that I used to use?*

Eventually, I stepped away from social media platforms for over six months. 

## 2. Life stage change: a great moment to reprioritize everything

> If you can live in that value-based, goal-oriented minimalism, it really simplifies your life.<br/>
> — Tom Turcich (Millennial Minimalists Podcast Ep. 222)

During my break from social media, I was busy reflecting on my life and reprioritizing everything. 

Life happened in many ways. And, I didn't know how life feels easy when its purpose is crystal-clear. My priorities have almost automatically reordered, and thanks to this, I finally could let go of the old belief I mentioned.

I listed my current priorities and criteria as follows: 
1. A flexible and autonomous lifestyle is crucial **→ <mark class="hl-pink-lt">working full-remotely is non-negotiable.</mark>**
2. I want to inspire people most efficiently **→ <mark class="hl-pink-lt">utilizing my visual design skills by making content online.</mark>**
3. The best way to make them real is to find an open-minded environment **→ (from my experience) <mark class="hl-pink-lt">IT industry is most likely to have</mark> it with some logicalness.**

Now I have no doubts about my direction, and, most importantly, I'm finally able to live in the present moment with my loved ones and with myself, too.

## So, now what?

I'm going to make this website a place to output

- **Insights and thoughts on design**
- **Work tips** (about tools, productivity, etc.)

And I think writing articles is the best first step that I can take.

So, this is how I decided to change the way I output what's on my mind. But, it doesn't mean that I neglected my past. <a href="https://v2024.erikaobama.com/" target="_blank">The previous version</a> of this website is still accessible, and here's my <a href="https://instagram.com/erika.obama" target="_blank">Instagram</a> where you can enjoy my 3D (and a few 2D) artworks.
