## 1. Inquiry and Contract Closing

1. Please send me an inquiry via <a href={contactBusinessEn} target="_blank">this contact form</a>. 
2. I will send you a detailed questionnaire based on your needs. Please fill and submit back.
3. After receiving the answer, I will estimate the production price and send you a quote. The start date will be discussed in this phase, too.
4. If you agree with the quote, I will send you an invoice for the upfront fee (30% of the total price). Please proceed with the payment by the previous day of the start date.   
(For the detailed information about the payment methods and due, please read “4-2. Payment” section.)  
5. Once the payment is received, the project will start.

On the start date, we will have an initial meeting online. A video call will be expected.  

In the meeting, we will discuss:

- The objective, concepts, and details of your business and your project

- Schedule (milestones, due, etc.)

## 4. Delivery and Payment

### 4-1. Delivery

I will finalize and deliver the finalized product to you, such as:

Depending on the contract, I will also deliver you the final version of the work data, such as:

If there is no issue with the delivered product and work data, the project ends.

After the project ends, I will send you an invoice. Please pay the rest of the price by the due date.  

Below are the default payment due and the acceptable payment options:

- Due date: The end of the next month after the project end date  
<span class="caption">(e.g., when the project ends on 8 February, the payment due date will be 31 March)</span>
  - If the payment date is Saturday, Sunday, or a holiday in the payer’s region, the due date will be on the previous weekday.
- Payment methods: Bank transfer (via SWIFT or a Japanese bank account)
